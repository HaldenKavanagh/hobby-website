          The walstead method is a natural way to set up your fishtank, without
          the need for water changes, regular cleaning, 02, C02, and eventually
          food. Aside from the cost of the tank and light, it can be done for
          free and requires little to no maintnence.

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        The most important part of a successfull Walstead tank is the bacteria,
        without it the tank would'nt function. It is because of this that the
        substrate is so important. By having a thin layer of soil at the bottom,
        and a deep layer of sand or gravel above it (atleast 2 inches), we can
        mimic the natural world to create a truly self sufficient ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>To understand this, you must know how the nitrogen cycle works.</p>
      <h3>The Nitrogen cycle and anaerobic denitrification</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>The Nitrogen cycle</h4>
          <p>
            The Nitrogen cycle is basically the food chain for plants and
            animals in your tank. When things like leftover fish food, dead
            organisms, and waste products decompose they turn to ammonia.
            Ammonia is very toxic to your tak, and if it builds up, everything
            will die. The ammonia is then broken down by nitrosomas (ammonia
            eating bacteria) It turns into something less harmfull but still
            detremental to your tank, nitrites These nitrates are then broken
            down by by bacteria in the genus Nitrobacter into nitrates.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, a water change would be done to rid your tank of the
            nitrates, however this is not neccesarily needed. Thats where the
            walstead method comes in.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Anaerobic Nitrification</h4>
          <p>
            Denitrification refers to the process where specific types of
            bacteria break down nitrates and nitrites into nitrogen gas.
            Denitrification only occurs anaerobically, meaning it only takes
            place where no oxygen is present. The bacteria that performs this is
            anaerobic, meaning they will die in contact with oxygen
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where the Walstead method's minimum two inches of sand comes
            to play. With a deep layer of sand, a portion of your tank exists
            where oxygen can penetrate, and thus creating an environment for
            denitrifying bacteria to live and complete the nitrogen cycle
            completely. This eliminates the need for water changes. It is very
            hard to get tis balance perfect, so expect to do mabie two 25% water
            changes a year

      <p>
        This method requires verry little investment, where the main cost is the
        tank and the light.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>The Tank</h4>
          <p>
            Any tank will do. As long as it holds water your good to go. Thrift
            stores are a viable option, as people often donate them in realy
            good condition.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Light</h4>
          <p>
            Sometimes people will donate their light along with their tank, bu
            more than likely it will not sustain your tank and give the plants
            everything they need. When shopping for a uv light, make sure that
            it is a full spectrum grow light. Having one specifically for
            aquarium plants is preferable but not crucial.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Substrates</h4>
          <p>
            This method uses a two-substrate method to ensure a layer where
            anaerobic bacteria can live. These layers include a thin, nutrient
            ritch layer of fertilizer capped by a thick layer of sand or fine
            gravel. for the first layer, you can buy expensive aquasoil and that
            works fine but for the budget route any old potting soil works
            great, just make sure to sift out all of the large debris
            beforehand. The same thing goes for the sand, you can go to the
            aquarium store and buy a big bag of ovepriced sand, or venture to
            your local river or lake to get some. Any sand will do, just try and
            get some cleanish sand or else it will take forever to clean. when
            you get home wash the sand thourally with water untill it runs
            clear. If you want to risk it, and you have some sand from a
            beutifull clean body of water you can attempt to skip the rinsing
            process but it is not recomended.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Decor</h4>
          <p>
            while getting your sand, you may see a cool looking rock, or branch
            of a tree that you find interesting. Bring it back with you and we
            can use it to decorate your tank. search for cool rocks and pieces
            of wood with lots of texture and interest. Alternitively, you can go
            to the fish store and buy some fancy rocks and wood. If you
            collected your hardscape naturally, boil them. this will kill
            anything hiding in them and help to waterlog the wood. If your wood
            floats when submerged in water, soak it in warm water, using
            something heavy to keep it fully submerged. When it sinks naturally
            it is ready for your tank.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>plants</h4>
          <p>
            when buying plants for the first time, you dont need to go crazy.
            Later on when they start growing you can simply replant your
            trimmings to have infinite plants. Look for plants that peak your
            interest, and are visually appealing to you, Contrast is usually
            good but in general get what you think looks cool. Depending on the
            tank size, it is only neccesary to get two types of stem plants, and
            probably some carpeting or floating plants. The more plant growth
            the better, so dont be afraid to heavily plant your tank, but if you
            are on a budget you can allways just replant the trimmings to
            populate the tank.
          </p>

          <h4>Optional: Sponge filter</h4>
          <p>
            A sponge filter is optional but can be an awesome addition to your
            tank. Buy a small oxygen pump and a sponge filter attatchment.
            connect the sponge filter to the air filter tube and put it in. It
            works by pushing O2 down the tube and into the filter. This release
            of gas creates a bit of a vacume that pulls the water into the
            sponge and filters it. You can get a pump for 15-20$ an the filter
            for around 10$.
