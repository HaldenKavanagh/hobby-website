          The walstead method is a natural way to set up your fishtank, without
          the need for water changes, regular cleaning, 02, C02, and eventually
          food. Aside from the cost of the tank, it can be done for free and
          requires little to no maintnence.

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        The most important part of a successfull Walstead tank is the bacteria,
        without it the tank would'nt function. It is because of this that the
        substrate is so important. By having a thin layer of soil at the bottom,
        and a deep layer of sand or gravel above it (atleast 2 inches), we can
        mimic the natural world to create a truly self sufficient ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>To understand this, you must know how the nitrogen cycle works.</p>
      <h3>The Nitrogen cycle and anaerobic denitrification</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>The Nitrogen cycle</h4>
          <p>
            The Nitrogen cycle is basically the food chain for plants and
            animals in your tank. When things like leftover fish food, dead
            organisms, and waste products decompose they turn to ammonia.
            Ammonia is very toxic to your tak, and if it builds up, everything
            will die. The ammonia is then broken down by nitrosomas (ammonia
            eating bacteria) It turns into something less harmfull but still
            detremental to your tank, nitrites These nitrates are then broken
            down by by bacteria in the genus Nitrobacter into nitrates.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, a water change would be done to rid your tank of the
            nitrates, however this is not neccesarily needed. Thats where the
            walstead method comes in.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Anaerobic Nitrification</h4>
          <p>
            Denitrification refers to the process where specific types of
            bacteria break down nitrates and nitrites into nitrogen gas.
            Denitrification only occurs anaerobically, meaning it only takes
            place where no oxygen is present, and the bacteria that performs
            this is anaerobic, meaning they will die in contact with oxygen
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where the Walstead method's minimum two inches of sand comes
            to play. With a deep layer of sand, a portion of your tank exists
            where oxygen can penetrate, and thus creating an environment for
            denitrifying bacteria to live and complete the nitrogen cycle
            completely. This eliminates the need for water changes. It is very
            hard to get tis balance perfect, so expect to do mabie two 25% water
            changes a year
